Bunny Bunch collects no data. Bunny Bunch never accesses the internet and has no telemetry or trackers.

If you attempt to use the multiplayer features, you may be prompted to allow 'local network access'.  That is used solely for the game to communicate with other devices over Bluetooth or your local WiFi network by leveraging Apple's official [Multipeer Connectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity) library.
